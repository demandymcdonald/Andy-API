You expressly acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, your use of the Software is at your sole risk. Andysoft shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses (even if Andysoft has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from:

The use or the inability to use the Software;
